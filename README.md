# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms

THIS REPOSITORY IS COMPLETE!

Lab numbers are according to the Lab manual. Though, I would recommend that you make your lab file program-wise , i.e, Do numbering according to programs( different serial numbers to different programs).

Most of the programs are mine while some are taken from others for the sake of completion of repository in time(credits are given to the respective code owners).
